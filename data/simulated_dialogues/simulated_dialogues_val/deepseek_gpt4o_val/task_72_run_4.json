Your job is to ask short, direct questions about What he said concerning his trip, his family and his birthday party. (e.g. \u201cWhat did he say about his family?\u201d, \u201cDid he say he\u2019ll celebrate his birthday in Madrid?', ' What did he say about his trip?\u201d) Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
