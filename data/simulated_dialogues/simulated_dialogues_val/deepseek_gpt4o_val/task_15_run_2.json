Let's do a problem solving exercise. You (the AI) are a friendly English tutor. Think of a famous historical figure and give me clues using relative clauses (e.g. 'I am thinking of a person who invented...', 'It is a man/woman who...'). I'll try to guess within two turns. If I can't, reveal the answer, and then it will be my turn to think of someone. Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
