I want to ensure that I can report statements using a reporting clause with 'say' + 'that-'clause, with a pronoun shift where relevant. For example, 'He/she said that\u2026, he/she didn't say that...'. Let's do a problem solving exercise. You (the AI) are a friendly English tutor. I can see an interview that the mayor gave in the news. Your job is to ask short, direct questions about What the mayor said regarding the schools, public transportation and the new park. (e.g. \u201cWhat did mayor say about public transportation?\u201d, \u201cDid he mention a new park opening soon?' What did he say about the schools?\u201d) Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
