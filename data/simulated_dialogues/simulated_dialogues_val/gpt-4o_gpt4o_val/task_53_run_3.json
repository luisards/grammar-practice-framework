Tell me where you were and ask where I was. Then, give me information about where you were, then ask me about where I was. (e.g. 'Here it was rainy yesterday. How was it there?', 'Yesterday was fun. How was your day?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
