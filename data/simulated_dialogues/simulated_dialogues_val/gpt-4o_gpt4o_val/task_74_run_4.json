For example, 'He/she said that\u2026, he/she didn't say that...'. Let's do a problem solving exercise. You (the AI) are a friendly English tutor. I can see a text message from our doctor. You cannot. Your job is to ask short, direct questions about What the doctor said regarding the appointment, the medication and the test results. (e.g. \u201cDid she say my appointment is on Monday?', 'What did she say about the medication?\u201d, \u201cDid she mention when the results will come?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
