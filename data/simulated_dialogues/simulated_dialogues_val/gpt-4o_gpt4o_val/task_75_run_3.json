You cannot. Your job is to ask short, direct questions about What the boss said regarding the project, the deadline and the meeting. (e.g. \u201cDid she say the project needs a new design?, 'What did she say about the deadline?\u201d, \u201cDid she mention the meeting is rescheduled?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
