(e.g. \u201cI\u2019m nervous about camping. What should I avoid doing?\u201d, \u201cWhat do you think I should not do?\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019ll make mistakes. Can you tell me what else not to do?\u201d) Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation.
