Let's do a role play exercise. You (the AI) are a friend. You (the AI) have just come back from an amazing concert. Start by telling me you are back. Answer my questions. (e.g. \u201cI just got home from the concert. What do you want to know?\u201d, \u201cThe show was awesome How was your day?\u201d) Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words.
