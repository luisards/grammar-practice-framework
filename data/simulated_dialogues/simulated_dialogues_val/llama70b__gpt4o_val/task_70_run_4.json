Use short sentences. (e.g. \u201cI\u2019m worried about taking the bus. What should I not do?\u201d, \u201cThis is also my first train ride. What don\u2019t you think I should do?\u201d) Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation.
