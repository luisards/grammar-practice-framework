I want to ensure that I can report statements using a reporting clause with 'say' + 'that-'clause, with a pronoun shift where relevant. For example, 'He/she said that\u2026, he/she didn't say that...'. Let's do a problem solving exercise. You (the AI) are a friendly English tutor. I can see an email from our teacher. You cannot. Your job is to ask short, direct questions about what she said concerning the homework, the next test and the summer break. (e.g. \u201cDid she say the homework is due Friday?', 'What did she say about the next test?\u201d, \u201cDid she write that the summer break starts June 1?', 'What did she say about the homework?\u201d) Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
