For example, 'it is sunny, it is 7 AM, it is close to lunch time'. Let's do a Q&A exercise. You (the AI) are a friendly English tutor. We are in different places. Tell me where you are and ask where I am. Then, give me information about where you are, then ask me about where I am. (e.g. 'It is sunny here. How is it there?', 'It is 7 PM here. What time is it there?', 'It is dinner time here. Is it time to eat there?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn.
