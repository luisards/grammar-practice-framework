Let's do a problem solving exercise. You (the AI) are a friendly English tutor. I see a table with information about 5 people's pets, you do not. Ask me short questions about them (e.g. 'Do all people have pets?', 'Do both women have dogs?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn.
