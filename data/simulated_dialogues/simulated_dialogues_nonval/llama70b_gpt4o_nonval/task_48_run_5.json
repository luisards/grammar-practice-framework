Start by telling me about a typical school/work day in your country using frequency adverbs, then ask me questions about my school routine. (e.g. 'I usually go to school at 7:30 am. How about you?', 'Do you sometimes study late at night?) Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation.
