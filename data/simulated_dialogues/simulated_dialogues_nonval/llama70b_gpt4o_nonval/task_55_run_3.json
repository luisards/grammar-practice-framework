Tell me the temperature using ‘it is’, then ask me short questions about the temperature where I am. (e.g. ‘It’s 15 °C here. WHat temperature is it there?’, 'It was 5 yesterday night! How much was it there?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
