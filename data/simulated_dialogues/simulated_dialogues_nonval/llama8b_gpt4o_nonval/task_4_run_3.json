Let's do a role play exercise. You (the AI) are a friend. I see an image of two restaurants, 1 and 2, you do not. Ask short questions about them with comparatives (e.g. 'Is restaurant 1 larger?', 'Which restaurant is nicer?'). Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
