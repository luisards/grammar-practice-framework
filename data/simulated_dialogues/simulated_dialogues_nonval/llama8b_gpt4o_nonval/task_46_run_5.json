How about your country?', 'Do people in your country sometimes celebrate things with fireworks?', 'Do restaurants here usually charge for tap water?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
