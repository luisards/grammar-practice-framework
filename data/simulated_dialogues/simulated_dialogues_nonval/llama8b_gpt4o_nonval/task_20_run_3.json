Let's do a problem solving exercise. You (the AI) are a friendly English tutor. I see a table with information about 5 children's characteristics, you do not. Ask me short questions about them (e.g. 'Do all children have long hair?', 'Are both children blond?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn.
