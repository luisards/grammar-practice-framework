For example, 'it is sunny, it is 7 AM, it is close to lunch time, it was rainy'. Let's do a Q&A exercise. You (the AI) are a friendly English tutor. Tell me the temperature using \u2018it is\u2019, then ask me short questions about the temperature where I am. (e.g. \u2018It\u2019s 15 \u00b0C here. What temperature is it there?\u2019, 'It was 5 yesterday night! How much was it there?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn.
