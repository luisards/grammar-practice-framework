Use short sentences. (e.g. \u201cI want to enjoy my trip. What should I not do?\u201d, \u201cI don't want to offend people. What should I not do in your country?\u201d, \u201cCan you tell me What else not to do?\u201d) Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn.
