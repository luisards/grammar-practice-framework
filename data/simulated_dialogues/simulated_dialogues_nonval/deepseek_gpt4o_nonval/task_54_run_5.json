I want to ensure that I can use 'it' as an empty subject when there is nothing else to put in subject position, particularly with weather or time. For example, 'it is sunny, it is 7 AM, it is close to lunch time, it was rainy'. Let's do a Q&A exercise. You (the AI) are a friendly English tutor. Start by describing the current season where you live using ‘it is’, then ask me questions about the season here. (e.g. 'It is spring here. What season is it there?', 'It is warm in spring here. How is it there?') Please use direct, short and simple sentences and easy words. Output only your next turn. Now let's naturally start our conversation. User: Hello!; System: "
