Let the eggs cook for about 9-12 minutes. Then, take them out and put them in cold water. This stops them from cooking more. That's it! Do you have any other cooking questions?"

Cook it for about 8-12 minutes, depending on the type. Taste a piece to see if it's done. Once ready, drain the water. You can add sauce or cheese if you like. Enjoy your pasta!
